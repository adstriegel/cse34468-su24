# Recap - Topics Covered - Lecture 4

## Block 1 

* Design discussion - self-checkout
* What is an A/D?
* What are the key properties of an A/D?
* Compare / contrast the following terms: resolution, range, min, max, step size, sampling rate.
* What is quantization?
* What is sampling rate?
* What is the difference between an analog value versus a digital value?
* What do we mean when we say discrete and approximate when it comes to an A/D?
* Convert an analog value to digital and vice versa.

## Block 2

* Continued work on Lab 3

## Block 3

* Convert an analog value to digital and vice versa.
* What are the three main types of A/Ds?
* Explain briefly how successive approximation works.
* What do we mean when we say that the A/D value always lags the real world?
* What are the ways to increase the accuracy of an A/D? 

## Looking Ahead

Next week, we will finish up discussing D/As (the reverse of A/Ds), cover the material with regards to motion and magnetics, and then get into networking (the I of IoT).
