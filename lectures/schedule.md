Each lecture period runs for three hours which are split up into blocks of roughly fifty minutes to one hour with a ten minute break between blocks. Generally, the cadence will be fifty minutes of lecture (Block 1), a ten minute break, one hour of lab (Block 2), a ten minute break, and fifty minutes of lecture.  On Mondays, there will be a weekly assignment that can be completed in the afternoon.  On Wednesdays, there will be time set aside for a quiz and there will not be an assignment posted. Labs may be completed / demonstrated during the lab time and generally will be completed in groups of up to three students.
