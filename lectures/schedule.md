# Schedule - CSE 34468 - Summer 2024

Each lecture period runs for three hours which are split up into blocks of roughly fifty minutes to one hour with a ten minute break between blocks. Generally, the cadence will be fifty minutes of lecture (Block 1), a ten minute break, one hour of lab (Block 2), a ten minute break, and fifty minutes of lecture.  On Mondays, there will be a weekly assignment that can be completed in the afternoon.  On Wednesdays, there will be time set aside for a quiz and there will not be an assignment posted. Labs may be completed / demonstrated during the lab time and generally will be completed in groups of up to three students.  

The various assignments and their respective due dates are listed at the bottom of the schedule and are also listed in the homework directory.

The listed schedule is tenative and may be modulated depending on how the semester progresses. Key changes are echoed below:
