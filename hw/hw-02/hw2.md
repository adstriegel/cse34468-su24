## Submission

To submit the homework, create a `hw-02` sub-directory in your Git repository under the `hw` directory. Place the respective files as noted in the instructions in that sub-directory.  Make sure to `commit` and `push` the files and then note the submission hash via Canvas.  Your `commit` message should start with `hw-02: YOUR MESSAGE`. 

You are welcome to do a single commit and push with everything or to do individual commits on each problem (recommended) followed by a push. You will only need to submit the last hash of your homework.

### Question 1 - 2 pts

What does it mean to sink current?

### Question 2 - 2 pts

Show an example circuit where a GPIO pin of the Raspberry Pi is used to turn on a LED in a current sink configuration.

### Question 3 - 3 pts

Read the information at the following URL:

[Python RPi GPIO Example](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-gpio/python-rpigpio-example)

Use the example code to set up a scenario where the light is turned on whenever the button is pressed.  

## Question 4 - 2 pts

What is the difference between a pull-up and a pull-down resistor? Why are they needed?

## Question 5 - 4 pts

Suppose we have the following configuration:

* The system clock runs at 8 MHz
* The pre-scalar for the timing sub-system is set to 256
* The duty cycle period is 60 Hz

If we want to have a 70% duty cycle, what are the number of ticks to wait in for the high state and the low state?

## Question 6 - 3 pts

Take a look at the following product by Withings, [a smart body scale](https://www.withings.com/de/en/body-comp/black/shop).  The scale is able to operate on AA batteries but yet uses WiFi to stay directly connected to the Internet.  Why might this be a viable design choice?

## Question 7 - 1 pt

List potential partners that you have in mind for your final project group.  If you do not have anyone in mind but are open to having Prof. Striegel assist you, please list that information here.

## Question 8 - 1 pt

Take a look back at the final project description from the first day of slides (Lecture 1 - Block 1). List two topics that you might be interested in exploring taking either from the list as given or ideas of your own.  These ideas do not need to be the same as your group members but you are welcome to discuss with potential group members.
