# Final Project

The purpose of the final project is conduct a review of technology where network-enabled embedded systems (IoT or IIoT - Industrial Internet of Things) are or potentially could play a significant role in industry, government, the environment, or individual daily lives.  For instance, example areas might include:

* Smart cities whereby sensors and actuation are used to improve or meet an important need.  For example, the City of South Bend employed the use of smart sewer systems whereby storm water could be redirected to avoid overflow to the river.  Alternatively, cities such as Barcelona and Philadelphia have attempted to utilize water flow sensors to better pinpoint leaks in water distribution.  
* Sophisticated power system monitoring such as smart meters and battery storage allow for an improved adoption of renewables and improved resilience in the face of natural disasters.
* Smart homes allow for improved energy savings as well as improved quality of life for users by adapting the home environment to minimize energy use when away and to elect to consume electricity or other energy sources at their lowest prices.
* Smart manufacturing can allow for improved inventory tracking, equipment monitoring / maintenance, and cost savings through improved processes by transitioning from paper tracking to fully digital / automated tracking.
* Numerous other examples

## Final Project Presentation

The goal of your project is to pick an area of interest that you as well as your group members can agree upon and then to conduct an analysis along the following aspects:

* The Past (five years or prior): What has been the traditional / non-embedded type of solutions employed?  Why did it evolve in that manner?  What are key inefficiencies or potential areas for improvement?  
* Current Trends (in the last few years): What are key ways in which IoT / IIoT devices are being proposed to be used to address those inefficiencies? What are key attributes of those systems?  For instance, are they battery powered?  How long are they deployed? How are they used (placed once, carried by a person, etc.)?  Who are key companies that are driving these trends?
* Future Trends (multiple years out): Where does this area seems to be trending? Are there any major technological breakthroughs that could be disruptive? Are there any opportunities that your group might see?

It is OK if the current trends are largely in a nascent state (e.g. interesting use cases but not widely deployed).  

## Project Deliverables

Your goal will be to create the following:

* [Pitch](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse34468-su24/blob/main/hw/final-project/fp-pitch.md) - Your pitch will be a very brief summary identifying the group members, the area, and one interesting technology that might fall into the current or future trends.  
* Final Project Video - Your final video will be a 7-10 minute presentation that captures the three aspects noted above.  Your group will need to motivate the area with a brief overview of the past and then look at key and future trends for the area.  While it will be hard to discern exactly what parts from the class might be present in the respective current or future trends, you should be able to walk through two or three significant trends in the space and discuss use cases of how said technology is improving the area.  You should also examine at least one future trend might significantly improve or disrupt the area.
* Supporting Documentation - Your group should prepare a document containing the major references used (at least 3, ideally more) along with a summary of those references that fed into your final project presentation.
