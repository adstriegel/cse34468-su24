| --- | --- | 
| **Assigned** | Monday, June 17th |

| **Canvas Link** | [Final Project Pitch](https://canvas.nd.edu/courses/92659/assignments/274666) | 
| **Points** | 16 points | 

For your final project pitch, the goal will be to capture the following in a short slide deck (3-5 slides):

* **Title Slide** -  Descriptive Title / General Focus Area + Group Member Names / Contact Information
* **Past / Motivation** - What has been traditionally done in this area - very brief
* **Trends / Interesting Tech** - What are two or three interesting pieces of technology related to this area that you intend to explore?

Your slide show will likely be on the order of 3-5 slides along with some pictures / illustrations on the past / interesting trends. You may elect to either pre-record your sides or you can present the slides live using either Google Slides or Power Point.  

## Due Date / Deliverable

The slide deck will be due just before the pitch which will occur at the end of class on Wednesday.  The quiz completion time will similarly be extended in the event that presentations run long.  In the event that you elect to submit a pre-recorded video, you may share a Google Drive link.
